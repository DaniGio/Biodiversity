# Biodiversity

## Project overview

This project will support this microbiology laboratory’s study to identify and document bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef, together with Improbable Beef, start up. 
The scope of this project is to create a dashboard that presents which bacterial species live in each participant navels.


## Summary
It was possible to build a dynamic dashboard to present which bacterial species live in each participant navels. 
Once the participant ID is selected the dashboard presents:

-	a complete the demographic information panel
-	a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. 
-	a bubble chart presenting  the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
-	a gauge chart to present the weekly washing frequency of the individual


The dashboard is available to public here:
